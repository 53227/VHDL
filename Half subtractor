-- VHDL code for a Half Subtractor

-- Entity declaration
entity half_subtractor is
    Port (
        A, B : in  std_logic;   -- Input bits A (minuend) and B (subtrahend)
        Diff : out std_logic;   -- Output Difference bit
        Bout : out std_logic    -- Output Borrow bit
    );
end half_subtractor;

-- Architecture implementation
architecture behavioral of half_subtractor is
begin
    -- Difference output logic (XOR operation)
    Diff <= A xor B;

    -- Borrow output logic (NOT and AND operations)
    Bout <= (not B) and A;

end behavioral;
