-- VHDL code for a Full Subtractor

-- Entity declaration
entity full_subtractor is
    Port (
        A, B, Bin : in  std_logic;   -- Input bits A (minuend), B (subtrahend), and Bin (borrow in)
        Diff      : out std_logic;   -- Output Difference bit
        Bout      : out std_logic    -- Output Borrow bit
    );
end full_subtractor;

-- Architecture implementation
architecture behavioral of full_subtractor is
begin
    -- Difference output logic (XOR operation)
    Diff <= A xor B xor Bin;

    -- Borrow output logic (NOT and AND operations)
    Bout <= (not B and A) or (not Bin and (A xor B));

end behavioral;
